# Floor Plan Editor

Originally created as part of a much larger project for my job but was scrapped due to a change in project scope. Due to my involvement with the editor feature, I was given full ownership of the code and have been given permission to present this on my github. All code found in this repository is my own. 

Since this was originally part of a much larger codebase some functionality is broken or has been removed. The major portion is in the save functionality and database connection. I am currently working on adding the functionality back and integrating it with a new database/backend. As it was originally using a serverless architecture with a non-relational database this will take me some time to complete. Additionally I'm working on migrating the project to Typescript which will make the code much easier to work with in the long run.

Other changes will involve updating the styling, adding color changing back to the tables, allowing users to increase table size, multi table selection, and copy/paste functionality. 

I am also considering to change the project into a mind map tool. I don't have a personal need for a floorplan editor but a mind map tool would be nice. The code itself is already fairly set up for it.

This is how the editor currently appears
